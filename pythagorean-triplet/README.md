# Pythagorean Triplet

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find the product a * b * c.

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for
which,

```
a**2 + b**2 = c**2
```

For example, 

```
3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.
```

To run the tests simply run the command `go test` in the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `-bench`
flag:

    go test -bench .
