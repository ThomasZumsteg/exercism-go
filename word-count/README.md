# Word Count

Write a program that given a phrase can count the occurrences of each word in that phrase.

For example for the input `"olly olly in come free"`

```plain
olly: 2
in: 1
come: 1
free: 1
```


To run the tests simply run the command `go test` in the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `-bench`
flag:

    go test -bench .
