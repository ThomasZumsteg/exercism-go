# Meetup

Calculate the date of meetups.

Typically meetups happen on the same day of the week.

Examples are

- the first Monday
- the third Tuesday
- the Wednesteenth
- the last Thursday

Note that "Monteenth", "Tuesteenth", etc are all made up words. There
was a meetup whose members realised that there are exactly 7 days that
end in '-teenth'. Therefore, one is guaranteed that each day of the week
(Monday, Tuesday, ...) will have exactly one date that is named with '-teenth'
in every month.

To run the tests simply run the command `go test` in the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `-bench`
flag:

    go test -bench .

For more detailed info about the Go track see the [help
page](http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-go.html).
